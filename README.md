Overview
This project gave me a chance to tackle techniques and concepts I hadn’t yet mastered, and I found a lot of inspiration, help, and ideas from different resources and websites. What seemed like a straightforward task at first turned out to have more layers, especially when it came to getting the alignment just right, not only for the buttons themselves but also for their interactive aspects.

Challenges & Learning Points

1. Alignment Issues
Getting everything perfectly aligned was a bit of a challenge, especially with how the interactive parts responded. I initially struggled with Flexbox, which wasn’t behaving as expected. After some troubleshooting, I figured out that specificity was causing the problem, so I ended up learning a lot more about specificity than I had planned.

2. Before & After Pseudo-Elements
I found working with ::before and ::after to be a bit tricky but essential to achieving the effects I had in mind. It took some trial and error, but I learned a lot about how these pseudo-elements work and how to use them effectively.

3. Keyframes
Adding animations with @keyframes was another interesting part of the project. Experimenting with different properties to make the buttons feel smooth and polished was a challenge, but in the end, it was rewarding to see the result.

4. Flexbox & Specificity
Flexbox gave me some unexpected issues, and after diving into it, I realized specificity was at play. This experience helped me understand CSS specificity much better and taught me how to approach styling more effectively.

Final Thoughts
In the end, I’m proud of how these buttons turned out. It was a great learning experience, and I feel like I came out of it with more skills and confidence to tackle similar projects. I’m happy with the final result and excited to keep building on what I’ve learned here.
